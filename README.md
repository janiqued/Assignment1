Contribution: 
The Horiseon website offers insightful information about Search Engine Optimization. In this assignment I tried to make the code as legiable as possible. This was done through consolidating many repeated css values by grouping classes together. Semantic HTML elements were used for clarity, often to replace the < div > tag. While comments are not necessary to the HTML's function, some comments were added to make the sections easier to identify.
